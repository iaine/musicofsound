<p><strong>The University of Oxford e-Research Centre and Centre for Digital Scholarship are delighted to announce a day's symposium and hack on sonification.</strong></p>

<p>
Sounds surround us everywhere, and in our urban and industrial environments we are permanently immersed in music and noise—alarms, vending machines, phones have familiarized us with mechanical sound as signal. Sonifications, or audiograms, are attracting attention as a method of re-presenting data, yet this area of study continues to be less studied than, for example, visual analytics.</p>
<p>
The celebrations of Ada Lovelace’s 200th birthday demonstrated a larger interest in the intersection of machinery, music, and culture, and pushed existing disciplinary boundaries. The symposium and hack day will build on this and we look forward to developing ideas and approaches together.</p>
<p>
We invite proposals for papers (including audio-papers) and posters on sound, its production, reception, technologies, sonic re-presentation, and exploration of the sonic world. Work in progress, particularly projects that involve creative coding and making, are also welcome.</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>All submissions should include a title, abstract, a brief biography of each author, and up to five keywords.</p>
 
Word counts apply to the text of the abstract, excluding titles, biographies and keywords.
<p>Speakers will be given 30 minutes each for papers and audio-papers: 20 minutes for presentation, and 10 minutes for discussion. Lightning talks to present the posters will be given 5 minutes each, with discussion taking place during poster sessions.</p>

<p>Proposals should not exceed 300 words.</p>


<h2>Submission Procedure</h2>

<p>Proposals must be submitted online, uploading them to ###.
 
<p>The deadline for submissions is Monday 6 March 2017.</p>
 
<p>Acceptances will be notified by Monday 13 March 2017.</p>

<h2>Hack</h2>

<p>For the hack, there is no requirement for technological, musical, or coding experience. Our hack day will experiment with ways of re-presenting data with sound or music and exploring the sonic world. We encourage you to bring data and existing projects to share, and to start on fresh ideas. The day will encourage networking and developing ideas and projects, ending with a showcase of what we’ve produced and future directions we might take. We hope many of us will find new collaborators and be inspired to pursue new projects.</p>


<p>Registration for the symposium and hack will open on Monday 6 March 2017.</p>
